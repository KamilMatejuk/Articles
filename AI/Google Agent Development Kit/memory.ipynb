      "\n",
      "*   **Cold and refreshing:** This is a big one!\n",
      "*   **Sweet:** Obviously!\n",
      "*   **Creamy or smooth:** Many ice creams have a rich, creamy texture.\n",
      "*   **Flavorful:** Whether it's fruity, chocolatey, or something else, you like a distinct taste.\n",
      "\n",
      "Based on those preferences, here are some other desserts you might really enjoy:\n",
      "\n",
      "**Similar Textures & Temperatures:**\n",
      "\n",
      "*   **Frozen Yogurt (FroYo):** Very similar to ice cream but often a bit tangier and sometimes perceived as a healthier option.\n",
      "*   **Sorbet/Sherbet:** If you like fruit flavors in your ice cream, you'll likely love sorbet. It's dairy-free and water-based, making it intensely refreshing and often very fruity. Sherbet is similar but usually contains a small amount of dairy or egg whites, giving it a slightly creamier texture than sorbet.\n",
      "*   **Gelato:** Italian ice cream that is denser, smoother, and often richer than American ice cream due to less air incorporated and typically a higher ratio of milk to cream.\n",
      "*   **Semifreddo:** An Italian dessert that's essentially a no-churn frozen dessert, often described as a cross between ice cream and mousse. It's semi-frozen, meaning it's lighter and airier than ice cream.\n",
      "*   **Frozen Mousse:** A rich, airy, and intensely flavored dessert that's frozen. It can be chocolate, fruit, or other flavors.\n",
      "\n",
      "**Creamy & Rich Desserts (Not Necessarily Frozen):**\n",
      "\n",
      "*   **Puddings & Custards:** Think of rich chocolate pudding, creamy vanilla bean custard, crème brûlée (with its glorious caramelized sugar crust), or panna cotta (a silky Italian cooked cream dessert).\n",
      "*   **Cheesecake:** Creamy, rich, and often has a graham cracker crust. You can find a huge variety of flavors.\n",
      "*   **Mousse (Chilled):** Light, airy, and intensely flavored. Chocolate mousse is a classic, but fruit mousses are also delicious.\n",
      "*   **Tiramisu:** A layered Italian dessert with coffee-soaked ladyfingers and a creamy mascarpone mixture.\n",
      "\n",
      "**Fruity & Refreshing (Can be chilled):**\n",
      "\n",
      "*   **Fruit Salads (with a twist):** Not just plain fruit! Think fruit salads with a light yogurt dressing, a touch of honey, or even a hint of mint.\n",
      "*   **Fruit Tarts/Pies:** Especially those with creamy fillings like pastry cream or custard.\n",
      "*   **Pavlova:** A meringue-based dessert with a crisp crust and soft, chewy interior, usually topped with whipped cream and fresh fruit.\n",
      "*   **Fruit Fool:** A simple British dessert made from puréed cooked fruit folded into whipped cream.\n",
      "\n",
      "**To give you even better recommendations, tell me:**\n",
      "\n",
      "*   **What are your favorite ice cream flavors?** (e.g., chocolate, vanilla, strawberry, mint chocolate chip, cookie dough)\n",
      "*   **Do you prefer very sweet desserts, or something a little less sweet?**\n",
      "*   **Are there any ingredients you absolutely dislike?**\n",
